# GCP Service Account DWD Detector

This repository contains a script for detecting Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Accounts (SA) with Domain-Wide Delegation (DWD) permissions.

## Changes Made

- Added a Python script `dwd_sa_detector.py` that checks for DWD permissions in GCP SAs and flags any that are found. This script uses the `google-auth` and `google-auth-httplib2` libraries to authenticate and create a service client. It then lists all the service accounts in the project and checks if they have the `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role, which is one of the roles that enables DWD.

- The script logs the details of the service accounts with DWD permissions into a file named `dwd_sa_details.txt`. This could be useful for auditing or further analysis.

## Installation

You need to install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
